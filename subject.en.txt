🛠️ **Technical Requirements:**

1️⃣ **Implementation:**
   - 🖥️ Must be in C++ for high performance.

2️⃣ **Low-Latency Performance:**
   - ⚡ Minimize processing and communication delays.
   - 🔄 Use asynchronous mechanisms (e.g., Boost.Asio).

3️⃣ **Error Handling & Logging:**
   - 🛡️ Gracefully handle API rate limits, disconnections, and invalid inputs.
   - 📜 Log important events and errors for debugging.

4️⃣ **WebSocket Server Functionality:**
   - 🤝 Manage multiple client connections efficiently.
   - 📬 Handle subscription requests for specific symbols.
   - 🚀 Broadcast updates to relevant clients with minimal delay.

5️⃣ **Data Handling:**
   - 📥 Fetch data from the Deribit API (REST and WebSocket).
   - 🔄 Efficiently parse and relay data to clients over WebSocket.

6️⃣ **Authentication:**
   - 🔑 Use API keys to securely authenticate requests to the Deribit API.

---

🚀 **Steps to Get Started:**

1️⃣ **Research Deribit API:**
   - 🔍 Understand REST API for placing, modifying, and canceling orders.
   - 🌐 Learn WebSocket API for real-time orderbook updates.

2️⃣ **Prototype REST Interactions:**
   - 🔧 Use `cpr` to authenticate and send requests for:
     - 📝 Placing orders.
     - ❌ Canceling orders.
     - ✏️ Modifying orders.
     - 📜 Fetching orderbooks and positions.

3️⃣ **Build the WebSocket Server:**
   - 🛠️ Use Crow (or another framework) to:
     - 🤝 Handle WebSocket connections.
     - 🔔 Manage symbol subscriptions.
     - 📡 Push real-time updates.

4️⃣ **Optimize for Low Latency:**
   - ⚡ Ensure minimal delays in data processing.
   - 🚀 Optimize WebSocket message handling.

5️⃣ **Implement Logging and Error Handling:**
   - 📜 Log key events and errors.
   - 🛡️ Handle API rate limits, WebSocket disconnects, and malformed requests.

📐 **High-Level Architecture:**

1️⃣ **REST Client (HTTP):**
   - Handles requests to Deribit’s REST API for order management and market data.

2️⃣ **WebSocket Client (to Deribit):**
   - Connects to Deribit’s WebSocket API for real-time updates.

3️⃣ **WebSocket Server (in Crow):**
   - Manages client connections and subscriptions.
   - 📡 Relays real-time updates to subscribed clients.

4️⃣ **Core Logic:**
   - 🚦 Manages subscriptions and data flow.
   - ⚡ Implements low-latency optimizations.

5️⃣ **Error Logging:**
   - Logs all API interactions and WebSocket messages for debugging.

💡 **Example Workflow:**

1️⃣ **Client subscribes to BTC-USD Futures orderbook via WebSocket:**
   - 🌐 Crow WebSocket server receives the subscription request.
   - 🔗 System connects to Deribit WebSocket API for BTC-USD Futures.
   - 📡 Streams real-time updates to your WebSocket server.
   - 🚀 WebSocket server pushes updates to the subscribed client.

2️⃣ **Client places a buy order via HTTP REST:**
   - 🛠️ System sends the request to Deribit’s REST API.
   - ✅ API processes and acknowledges the order.

---

📦 **Optional Enhancements:**
- 📊 Add monitoring metrics (e.g., connection uptime, latency).
- 🔒 Implement secure WebSocket connections (WSS).
- 📋 Include comprehensive documentation for setup and troubleshooting.
